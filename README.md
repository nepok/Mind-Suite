# Mind Suite

**Mind Suite** is a project that was developed for my Bachelor Thesis with the title "Mind Suite - Conception and Realisation of prototypical Userinterfaces between Electroencephalography and Algorithmic Composition". 
This Plug-In Suite is an attempt to make music with your brain.
The Project is made for an *Emotiv EPOC* + in addition with a *Emotiv PRO License*, a *Python-Script* with the *Emotiv Cortex Library* and works in *Ableton Live* using *Max for Live*.
If you shouldÂ´nt own these products, you can try it out anyways with the prerecorded Brain Data that comes with the Suite.
