# Mind Suite

Mind Suite is a project that was developed for my Bachelor Thesis. The title is "Mind Suite - Conception and Realisation of prototypical Userinterfaces between Electroencephalography and algorithmic composition" and this Plug-In Suite is an attempt to make music with your brain.
The Project is made for an Emotiv EPOC + in addition with the Emotiv PRO License, a Python-Script with the Emotiv Cortex Library and works only in Ableton Live using Max for Live.
If you shouldÂ´nt own these products, you can try it out anyways
