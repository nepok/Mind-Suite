# Mind Suite

**Mind Suite** is a project that was developed for my Bachelor Thesis with the title "Mind Suite - Conception and Realisation of prototypical Userinterfaces between Electroencephalography and Algorithmic Composition". 
This Plug-In Suite is an attempt to make music with your brain.
The Project is made for an *Emotiv EPOC* + in addition with a *Emotiv PRO License*, a *Python-Script* with the *Emotiv Cortex Library* and works in *Ableton Live* using *Max for Live*.
If you shouldÂ´nt own these products, you can try it out anyways with the prerecorded Brain Data that comes with the Suite.


## Requirements

1. Install *python-osc*, *jsonlib* and *numpy*:
`$pip install python-osc` (https://pypi.org/project/python-osc/)  
`$pip install jsonlib` (https://pypi.org/project/jsonlib/)  
`$pip install numpy` (https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)  
2. Get a EMOTIV EPOC, should work with different models too
3. Purchase a PRO-License at Emotiv (https://www.emotiv.com/emotivpro/), get your License Key, your Client ID and your Client secret and insert it into osc_stream.py
